# Software-Foundations-Checklist

A checklist of the exercises I have completed in the [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html) series.

## Why a checklist?  Why not a collection of solutions?

[Software Foundations - Volume 1: Logical Foundations - Preface - Practicalities - Exercises](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Preface.html#lab10) explicitly requests its readers to not share solutions online in order not to spoil any university courses that may utilize it as a teaching resource or course curriculum:

> Please do not post solutions to the exercises in a public place.

As such, this checklist is more meant as a way for me to track my progress through the series than a concrete proof of the exercises that I have completed in the series.
